Initial Commit:  This holds the 0.1 release of the Local files for configuring the RasPiConnect App

There are four repositories 

1) ProjectCuracao - contains the main software for the Raspberry Pi 

2) RasPiConnectServer - contains the files to talk to the iPhone/iPad App RasPiConnect 

3) RasPiConnectXML - contains the XML configuration files for the RasPiConnect App

4) BatteryWatchdog - contains the code for the Arduino battery watchdog part of the project
